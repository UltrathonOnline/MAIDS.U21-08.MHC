This repository contains the MAIDS description for project U21-01. It was built by cloning the [MAIDS-Template](https://github.com/PERSIMUNE/MAIDS-Template). You will find more details about this dataset below with links to visit the website and download the PDF.

>MAIDS is currently being prototyped for the [Copenhagen Ultrathon on Precision Medicine](https://ultrathon.online) where you will find more information about the event. You may also be interested in viewing other examples listed in the 2021 Ultrathon [Project Pool](https://github.com/UltrathonOnline/U21-PROJECT-POOL).

Previous efforts of predicting peptide:MHC binding have been based on training data have been based
on affinity (ability to bind) and not stability (staying bound). We have found the latter to be much
more predictive for actually getting an immune reaction. Being able to predict immune response is
critical for vaccine design (you want immune response), drug design (you don’t want an immune response).
The dataset consists of two types of data one is precise and expensive, the other less precise
(binding/non-binding) and less expensive. Being able to make the full use the cheap data in a model
would mean an explosion of available data for this type of problems.
