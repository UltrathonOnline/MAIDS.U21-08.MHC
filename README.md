MAIDS is currently being prototyped for the [Copenhagen Ultrathon on Precision Medicine](https://ultrathon.online) where you will find several examples.

This repository is intended to maintain the code and protocols for authoring new MAIDS documents based on the MAIDS specification ([maintained separately](https://github.com/PERSIMUNE-Health-Informatics/MAIDS-Specification)). The specification is included as a submodule ensuring proper tracking of provenance when forking this repo to create new MAIDS documents.

Please watch/star if you'd like to be notified of new developments.
